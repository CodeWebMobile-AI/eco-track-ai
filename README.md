## Architecture Details

### Full-Stack Blueprint for eco-track-ai

A comprehensive architecture, design system, and feature roadmap for the eco-track-ai project, focusing on scalability, security, and user experience.

### Design System

*   **Suggested Font:**
    *   Font Name: Inter
    *   Google Font Link: [https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter)
    *   Font Stack: `'Inter', sans-serif`
    *   Rationale: Inter is a typeface designed for computer screens, with a focus on high legibility and readability at small sizes. Its modern, clean design will provide a professional look and feel.
*   **Color Palette:**

    Rationale: A harmonious and accessible color palette using a complementary scheme. The primary and secondary colors offer visual appeal, while the accent color provides clear call-to-action cues. Neutral tones ensure readability and accessibility, while the semantic colors (success, warning, danger) aid in clear communication.

    | Name               | Hex     | Usage                                                                   |
    | ------------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Primary            | #2E7D32 | Main brand color, used for headers and primary actions. (Green emphasizes environmental focus) |
    | Secondary          | #689F38 | Supporting color for secondary elements. (Lighter green complements the primary) |
    | Accent             | #FFC107 | Used for call-to-action buttons and highlights. (Yellow/Gold provides visual contrast) |
    | Neutral Text       | #212121 | Primary text color for high contrast and readability. (Very dark grey) |
    | Neutral Background | #F5F5F5 | Main background color for content areas. (Light grey)                 |
    | Neutral Border     | #BDBDBD | For card borders, dividers, and form inputs. (Medium grey)           |
    | Success            | #4CAF50 | For success messages and confirmation. (Green)                        |
    | Warning            | #FF9800 | For warnings and non-critical alerts. (Orange)                      |
    | Danger             | #F44336 | For error messages and destructive actions. (Red)                       |

### Foundational Architecture

#### 1. Core Components & Rationale

The architecture is built upon the Laravel backend and a React/Inertia.js frontend. Laravel provides robust API capabilities, authentication, and database management. React/Inertia.js delivers a dynamic and responsive user interface. Redis is used for real-time functionality via Laravel Echo Server. Typescript is used for the frontend for type safety.

*   **Backend:** Laravel (PHP 8.3+), Eloquent ORM, Sanctum for API authentication
*   **Frontend:** React (with TypeScript), Inertia.js, Tailwind CSS (pre-configured by the starter kit - can be extended with custom styles)
*   **Real-time:** Redis, Laravel Echo Server
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (Scalable and reliable, supports advanced data types. Alternatives: MySQL/MariaDB are acceptable.)
*   **APIs:** RESTful APIs using Laravel's built-in features. Consider using API Resources for data transformation.
*   **AI Engine:** A dedicated service (potentially Python-based microservice) communicating with the main Laravel application via API.

#### 2. Database Schema Design

The database schema will consist of the following core entities:

*   **Users:** (id, name, email, password, created_at, updated_at) - Standard user authentication information.
*   **Products:** (id, barcode, name, description, ingredients, manufacturer, certifications, carbon_footprint, sustainability_score, created_at, updated_at) - Stores product information. barcode should be indexed for quick lookups.
*   **User\_Product\_Impact:** (id, user\_id, product\_id, date, quantity, impact\_score, created\_at, updated\_at) - Tracks a user's interaction with a product and its impact. Includes quantity to account for the amount used.
*   **Sustainability\_Scores:** (id, product\_id, score, date, calculation\_method, data\_sources, created\_at, updated\_at) - Detailed sustainability score history and the methodology used to calculate it. Allows for auditing and adjustments.
*   **Eco\_Challenges:** (id, name, description, start\_date, end\_date, points\_awarded, created\_at, updated\_at) - Stores eco-challenge information.
*   **User\_Eco\_Challenge:** (id, user\_id, eco\_challenge\_id, completed, completion\_date, created\_at, updated\_at) - Tracks user progress on eco-challenges.

Indexes should be added to foreign keys for performance. Consider using UUIDs instead of auto-incrementing integers for IDs in a distributed environment.

#### 3. API Design & Key Endpoints

RESTful API design principles will be followed. API Resources will be used for transforming data to a consistent format.

*   `/api/products/{barcode}`: GET - Retrieve product details by barcode. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/products/search`: GET - Search for products by name or keywords. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/sustainability-score/{product_id}`: GET - Get the sustainability score for a product. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/user/dashboard`: GET - Get the user's dashboard data. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/user/impact`: GET - Get the user's overall environmental impact. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/user/eco-challenges`: GET - Get the user's eco-challenges. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/user/eco-challenges/{id}/complete`: POST - Mark an eco-challenge as complete. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/recommendations/{product_id}`: GET - Get recommendations for sustainable alternatives. (Protected: Requires authentication)
*   `/api/auth/login`: POST - User login.
*   `/api/auth/register`: POST - User registration.
*   `/api/auth/logout`: POST - User logout.

Input validation will be performed using Laravel's validation features. Response codes will adhere to HTTP standards (200 OK, 201 Created, 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).

#### 4. Frontend Structure (TypeScript)

The frontend will be structured using React components and Inertia.js pages, organized into logical modules. All components will be written in TypeScript (.tsx files).

*   **Components:** Reusable UI elements (e.g., buttons, forms, cards).
*   **Pages:** Inertia.js pages that represent different routes (e.g., Dashboard, Product Details).
*   **Layouts:** Shared layouts for consistent UI (e.g., DefaultLayout, GuestLayout).
*   **Services:** TypeScript classes or functions for interacting with the API (e.g., ProductService, UserService).
*   **Types:** TypeScript type definitions for data models (e.g., Product, User, SustainabilityScore).
*   **Contexts:** React Contexts for managing global state (e.g., UserContext, ThemeContext).
*   **Hooks:** Custom React hooks for reusable logic (e.g., useBarcodeScanner, useSustainabilityScore).

The folder structure might look like this:

```
resources/
 ├── js/
 │   ├── Components/
 │   │   ├── Button.tsx
 │   │   ├── Input.tsx
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Pages/
 │   │   ├── Dashboard.tsx
 │   │   ├── ProductDetails.tsx
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Layouts/
 │   │   ├── DefaultLayout.tsx
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Services/
 │   │   ├── ProductService.ts
 │   │   ├── UserService.ts
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Types/
 │   │   ├── Product.ts
 │   │   ├── User.ts
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Contexts/
 │   │   ├── UserContext.tsx
 │   │   └── ...
 │   ├── Hooks/
 │   │   ├── useBarcodeScanner.ts
 │   │   ├── useSustainabilityScore.ts
 │   │   └── ...
 │   └── app.tsx // Main entry point
```

#### 5. Real-time & Events Architecture

Redis and Laravel Echo Server will be used for real-time updates. Events will be broadcast from the Laravel backend to connected clients.

*   **Laravel Events:** Define Laravel events for actions that require real-time updates (e.g., `ProductSustainabilityScoreUpdated`, `EcoChallengeCompleted`).
*   **Broadcast Channels:** Use private or presence channels for secure real-time communication.
*   **Laravel Echo:** Configure Laravel Echo in the frontend to subscribe to the broadcast channels and handle the events.
*   **Redis:** Redis will be used as the message broker for Laravel Echo Server.
*   **laravel-echo-server:** Must be configured and running locally (as specified). Use a process manager like Supervisor to ensure it's always running in production.

Example:

```php
// Laravel Event
class ProductSustainabilityScoreUpdated implements ShouldBroadcast
{
    public $product;

    public function __construct(Product $product)
    {
        $this->product = $product;
    }

    public function broadcastOn()
    {
        return new PrivateChannel('product.' . $this->product->id);
    }
}
```

```typescript
// React Component
import Echo from 'laravel-echo';

useEffect(() => {
    const echo = new Echo({
        broadcaster: 'socket.io',
        host: window.location.hostname + ':6001' // Default laravel-echo-server port
    });

    echo.private(`product.${productId}`)
        .listen('ProductSustainabilityScoreUpdated', (e) => {
            // Update the sustainability score in the component's state
            setSustainabilityScore(e.product.sustainability_score);
        });

    return () => echo.disconnect();
}, [productId]);
```

#### 6. Authentication & Authorization Flow

Laravel Sanctum will be used for API authentication. Sanctum provides a lightweight authentication system for SPAs and mobile applications.

*   **Registration:** Users register via the `/api/auth/register` endpoint.
*   **Login:** Users log in via the `/api/auth/login` endpoint, receiving an API token.
*   **Authentication:** The API token is included in the `Authorization` header of subsequent requests (Bearer token).
*   **Authorization:** Middleware will be used to protect API endpoints and ensure that only authorized users can access them. Laravel's built-in authorization features (Policies) can be used for fine-grained access control. Role-based access control (RBAC) can be implemented if needed.
*   **Logout:** Users log out via the `/api/auth/logout` endpoint, invalidating their API token.

Consider implementing two-factor authentication (2FA) for enhanced security.

#### 7. Deployment & Scalability Plan

The application will be deployed to a cloud platform such as AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean.

*   **Infrastructure:** Use containerization (Docker) and orchestration (Kubernetes) for scalability and portability.
*   **Web Server:** Nginx or Apache will serve the application.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL will be deployed as a managed service (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) for automatic backups and scaling.
*   **Caching:** Redis will be used for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance.
*   **Load Balancing:** A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple application instances.
*   **Scaling:** Horizontal scaling will be used to handle increased traffic by adding more application instances. Auto-scaling can be configured to automatically add or remove instances based on demand.
*   **CI/CD:** Implement a CI/CD pipeline using tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI/CD for automated testing and deployment.

For the AI-powered engine, consider deploying it as a separate microservice that can be scaled independently.

#### 8. Testing Strategy

A comprehensive testing strategy is essential for ensuring the quality and reliability of the application.

*   **Backend (Pest):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and classes in isolation.
    *   **Feature Tests:** Test the API endpoints and ensure that they behave as expected.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components (e.g., API endpoints and database).
*   **Frontend (Vitest & RTL):**
    *   **Unit Tests:** Test individual React components in isolation.
    *   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different React components.
    *   **End-to-End Tests (Cypress or Playwright):** Test the entire application flow from the user's perspective.
*   **Database Tests:** Test database interactions and ensure that data is stored and retrieved correctly. Use database transactions to rollback changes after each test.
*   **Code Coverage:** Aim for high code coverage (80%+) to ensure that all parts of the code are tested.

Continuous Integration (CI) will be used to automatically run tests on every commit.

#### 9. Security & Hardening Plan

A 'security-first' approach is mandatory, addressing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

*   **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation:**
    *   **Injection:** Use parameterized queries and prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Sanitize user input to prevent XSS.
    *   **Broken Authentication:** Use strong password policies and implement multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit. Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   **XML External Entities (XXE):** Disable XXE processing.
    *   **Broken Access Control:** Implement proper authorization checks to prevent unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Security Misconfiguration:** Securely configure the web server and database. Keep software up to date.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Sanitize user input and use output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
    *   **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities:** Keep all dependencies up to date and monitor for known vulnerabilities. Use tools like Snyk or Dependabot.
    *   **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Perform penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the application.
*   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate all user input to prevent malicious data from being processed.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   **CSRF Protection:** Laravel's CSRF protection is enabled by default. Ensure it is properly configured.
*   **Helmet.js (Frontend):** Use Helmet.js to set security-related HTTP headers. Source: [https://helmetjs.github.io/](https://helmetjs.github.io/)

#### 10. Logging & Observability

Comprehensive logging and monitoring are essential for understanding the application's behavior and identifying potential issues.

*   **Logging:**
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Use a centralized logging system such as ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Graylog.
    *   **Structured Logging:** Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON) to make logs easier to query and analyze.
    *   **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (e.g., DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) to indicate the severity of the log message.
    *   **stderr Channel:** Configure Laravel's logging to use the `stderr` channel for sending logs to standard error. This is beneficial in containerized environments where logs are often collected from `stderr` and `stdout`.
*   **Monitoring:**
    *   **Application Performance Monitoring (APM):** Use an APM tool such as New Relic or Datadog to monitor the application's performance.
    *   **Key Metrics:** Monitor key metrics such as response time, error rate, and CPU utilization.
    *   **Alerting:** Configure alerts to notify the team when critical issues occur.
    *   **Health Checks:** Implement health checks to monitor the availability of the application and its dependencies.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** Use distributed tracing to track requests as they flow through the application.
*   **Log Rotation:** Configure log rotation to prevent logs from filling up the disk.
