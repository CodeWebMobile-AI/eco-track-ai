## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Problem Statement

Businesses and individuals face a significant challenge in understanding and reducing their environmental impact. The lack of transparent and accessible tools to track carbon footprints, coupled with the complexity of identifying sustainable alternatives, hinders informed decision-making. This leads to unnecessary waste, increased emissions, and difficulty in meeting Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) reporting requirements.

### 1.2 Target Audience

Eco-Track-AI is designed for the following target audiences:

*   **Environmentally Conscious Businesses:** Companies seeking to reduce their operational carbon footprint, improve sustainability practices, and enhance their brand image.
*   **Sustainability Managers:** Professionals responsible for developing and implementing sustainability strategies within organizations.
*   **Eco-Minded Individuals:** Individuals committed to reducing their personal environmental impact through informed consumption and lifestyle choices.
*   **Organizations with ESG Reporting Requirements:** Businesses and institutions required to report on their environmental performance to meet regulatory or investor expectations.

### 1.3 Goals

The primary goals of Eco-Track-AI are:

*   Provide accurate and user-friendly carbon footprint tracking.
*   Offer actionable sustainability recommendations tailored to user activities.
*   Facilitate progress monitoring and goal setting for environmental impact reduction.
*   Streamline ESG reporting and compliance processes.
*   Foster a community of users engaged in sustainable practices through challenges and achievements.

### 1.4 System Architecture Overview

Eco-Track-AI will employ a three-tier architecture:

*   **Frontend (Presentation Tier):** A responsive web and mobile application providing users with an intuitive interface for interacting with the system.  Built with React.
*   **Backend (Application Tier):** A RESTful API built with Python (FastAPI) that handles business logic, data processing, and user authentication.
*   **Database (Data Tier):** A PostgreSQL database storing user data, activity records, emission factors, recommendations, reports, and other relevant information.

**Explanation of Tables:**

*   **Users:** Stores user account information. `user_type` distinguishes between individual and business accounts.
*   **Activities:** Records user activities that contribute to their carbon footprint.  Links to the `Emissions` table after emission calculation. The `emission_id` is nullable because the emission will be calculated in an async job.
*   **EmissionFactors:** Contains data on emission factors for various activities, fuels, and regions.  Crucial for calculating carbon footprints. Uses specific `co2_factor`, `ch4_factor`, and `n2o_factor` for more accurate calculations with the greenhouse gas global warming potentials (GWP).
*   **Emissions:** Stores the calculated carbon emissions associated with each activity. Stores the total `co2_equivalent`.
*   **Goals:** Defines user-set goals for reducing their environmental impact.
*   **Reports:** Stores generated reports on user carbon footprint and progress towards goals.  The `data` field is a JSON blob to accommodate flexible report formats.
*   **Recommendations:** Provides suggestions to users on how to reduce their carbon footprint.
*   **UserRecommendations:** Tracks which recommendations have been presented to users and whether they have acted on them.
*   **Challenges:** Defines community challenges to encourage sustainable behavior.
*   **UserChallenges:** Tracks user participation and progress in challenges.
*   **Achievements:** Defines achievements users can earn for reaching specific milestones.
*   **UserAchievements:** Tracks user achievement completions.

        *   Database:  Add columns to the `Activities` table to support third-party integrations.  Create the `Reports` and `Recommendations` tables.
        *   Frontend:  Create the report viewing and recommendation display components in React. Add charts and graphs using Chart.js for data visualization.
        *   Data processing: Celery tasks should be set up to calculate reports on a regular basis or trigger the calculation after certain activities are completed.
    *   **Timeline:** 3 months

**Phase 3: ESG Reporting and Community Features**

*   **Goal:**  Implement features for ESG reporting and build a community platform for users.
    *   **Features:**

        *   Predictive carbon footprint analysis.
        *   Personalized sustainability plans.
    *   **Technical Details:**
        *   Backend:  Integrate with a machine learning platform (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) to train models for recommendation and prediction. Deploy the models as microservices using Docker and Kubernetes.
        *   Data:  Collect user data on activity patterns, preferences, and responses to recommendations to train the AI models.
        *   Frontend:  Display the AI-powered recommendations and predictions in the user interface.
    *   **Timeline:** Ongoing

**Detailed Feature Breakdown:**

*   **Carbon Footprint Calculator:**
    *   Technical Details: This feature uses data from the EmissionFactors table to calculate the carbon footprint.  The calculation involves multiplying the amount of activity by the appropriate emission factor. Specific factors for CO2, CH4, and N2O should be used to improve accuracy, with global warming potentials (GWP) factored in before summing the total CO2 equivalent.
    *   Example: If a user enters 100 kWh of electricity consumption in California, the calculator will look up the corresponding emission factor in the `EmissionFactors` table (e.g., 0.0003 kg CO2e/kWh) and calculate the carbon footprint as 100 \* 0.0003 = 0.03 kg CO2e. This would then factor in CH4 and N2O contributions to the overall number.

*   **Real-time Emissions Tracking:**
    *   Technical Details: This feature requires the backend to process activities and calculate emissions in near real-time.  This can be achieved using message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) to handle asynchronous processing.  The frontend will display the updated emissions data using web sockets (e.g., Socket.IO) to provide real-time updates.
    *   Implementation: The frontend will subscribe to a websocket channel. Everytime an activity is added, the emission calculation service will calculate the emission and broadcast the new total to the channel so the frontend can update the display.

*   **Sustainability Recommendations:**
    *   Technical Details: This feature will use the data in the `Recommendations` table to provide personalized suggestions to users. The recommendations will be filtered based on the user's activity history and preferences. AI models (trained on user behavior and environmental impact) will be used to provide even more personalized and effective recommendations in later phases.
    *   Algorithm: The recommendation engine will use a combination of content-based filtering (matching recommendations based on activity type) and collaborative filtering (finding similar users and recommending actions they have taken).

*   **ESG Reporting:**
    *   Technical Details: This feature requires the backend to generate reports in standard ESG formats (e.g., GRI, SASB).  The reports will include data on carbon emissions, energy consumption, waste generation, and other relevant metrics.  A dedicated ESG reporting service will be created, able to extract data from various tables in the database. The service should also be extensible so that more report types can be added in the future.
    *   Templates: The reporting service will use templates (e.g., Jinja2 templates) to generate the reports. These templates can be customized to meet the specific reporting requirements of different organizations.

*   **Community Challenges:**
    *   Technical Details: This feature will allow users to participate in challenges to reduce their carbon footprint.  The challenges will be tracked using the `UserChallenges` table. The progress towards completing a challenge will be calculated based on the user's activity data.
    *   Gamification: This feature will incorporate gamification elements (e.g., points, badges, leaderboards) to encourage user engagement.

**Technology Stack Summary:**

*   **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, Chart.js, WebSockets (Socket.IO)
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI), PostgreSQL, Celery, Redis, JWT, OAuth 2.0, Docker, Kubernetes
*   **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch (for future AI-powered features)
*   **Infrastructure:** AWS, Google Cloud Platform, or Azure
